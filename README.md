# crypto-test

Qt Project demonstrating symmetric encryption using OpenSSL.

The demonstration is based on the example listed in [C++ Programs](https://wiki.openssl.org/index.php/EVP_Symmetric_Encryption_and_Decryption#C.2B.2B_Programs) on the OpenSSL wiki.

Class `Crypto` provides functions `encrypt` and `decrypt` that implements AES encryption and decryption.

This is merely a proof-of-concept to illustrate how one might implement OpenSSL encryption with Qt. Use at own risk!
